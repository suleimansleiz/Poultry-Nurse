    <string name="cholera_header">Fowl Cholera</string>
    <string name="cholera_description">
        Fowl Cholera is a chronic disease caused by Pasteurella Multocidathat can affect the joints, wattles, infraohits, sinuses and other tissues.
        Common symptoms include loss of appetite, diarrhea with a greenish tinge, ruffled feathers, swollen purple wattle, swollen comb, swollen joints, lameness, oral, nasal and ocular discharge and sudden death.
Most commonly found in older chickens, Fowl Cholera affects more cocks than it does hens
    </string>
    <string name="coccidiosis_header">Coccidiosis</string>
    <string name="coccidiosis_description">
        Coccidiosis is a parasitic disease caused by Coccidian protozoa that lives in and damages a specific region of the gut in chickens.
        The trouble starts when chickens consume a sporulated oocyst which is broken down by chemicals in the gut, releasing an infective sporocyst. This begins the life cycle that causes the destruction of intestinal epithelial cells.
Together with damage to the gut walls, it causes loss of appetite, diarrhea, ruffled feathers, weight loss and inability to absorb nutrients.
    </string>
    <string name="flue_header">Avian Influenza</string>
    <string name="flue_description">
        Avian influenza is a disease caused by type A Orthomyxoviruses.
        They are commonly found and spread by wild aquatic birds which infect domesticated poultry. Diarrhea, nasal discharge, edema in the comb and wattles, purple discoloration, coughing and sneezing, swelling, ruffled feathers and more are symptoms of the bird flu.
Once spread, avian influenza is deadly.
    </string>
    <string name="newcastle_header">Newcastle Disease</string>
    <string name="newcastle_description">
        Newcastle disease is an acute respiratory disease that can spread rapidly.
        Symptoms of the disease depends on whether the infecting virus has a predilection for respiratory, digestive, or nervous systems. While it can affect both wild and domesticated fowl, domestic poultry is much more susceptible to contract severe symptoms.
    </string>
    <string name="salmonella_header">Salmonellosis</string>
    <string name="salmonella_description">
        Salmonellosis is a bacterial disease that can cause septicemia and enteritis in young chickens.
        With a low mortality rate, infections are contracted orally and can be spread by rodents.
Symptoms of salmonellosis include diarrhea, closed eyes, loss of appetite, thirst, ruffled feathers and dejection.
